# The K-Means Clustering Algorithm in C#

It’s been a while since I started to study this algorithm for one of my projects. It’s a nice, straightforward, yet efficient algorithm to classify some data into different groups. A couple of days ago, I decided to implement the algorithm in C#. You may find the full article at https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/985824/Implementing-The-K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm-in-C.
