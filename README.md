# K-Means Clustering Algorithm in C#
This project presents an implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm in C#. K-Means is a widely used clustering algorithm that efficiently classifies data into distinct groups. The project is a culmination of my study and exploration of this algorithm, aiming to provide a clear and efficient implementation in the C# programming language.
